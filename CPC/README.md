# Faceted Frequency Browser

This is the main directory for Faceted Frequency Browser's source code. 

The latest prototype of the Faceted Frequency Browser can be interacted with at:

Please note that the prototype at this link is a proof of concept, and it may contain some bugs.

FFB was formerly called 'Conditional Probability Calculator' (CPC). 
For consistency, the tool is referred by this original name in this directory. A refactoring could be done once the name FFB is no longer a working title, but is final.
