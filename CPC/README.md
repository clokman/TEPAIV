To view demos: 
1. Clone or download the TEPAIV repository (i.e., the parent directory). 
2. Navigate to demos folder of a project (e.g., TEPAIV/CPC/demos) and enter the directory of the demo you wish to see.
3. Open index.html of that directory.

**Note**: The index.html in the root (this directory) of a project usually contains the latest demo, but it may, break or be unavailable at times during the development of the app. For reliable snapshots/demos of the project, please see demos directory instead.
